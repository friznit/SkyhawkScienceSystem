//Tiers
// Tier 0 - Starting Gear - basic low atmospheric sounding rockets - may be merged with tier 1
// Tier 1 - Sounding Rockets - Capable of reaching space, along with the first introduction of Kerolox
// Tier 2 - Early Orbital Rockets - think Sputnik, Vangaurd, Scout, and Redstone/Explorer 1 - probes like Sputnik and Explorer 1 - 1.25m parts
// Tier 3 - Improved Orbital Rockets - think Thor, Juno II, Agena A, etc - basic orbital research and comms sats - 1.5m parts
// Tier 4 - Mature Orbital Rockets - Advanced Thor, Agena B, Delta E and F, and early 1.875 rockets like Atlas and Agena - probes focus on the Ranger missions to the Moon/Mun&Minmus
// Tier 5 - High-Performance Rockets - Atlas, Titan II, Centaur, Delta II, Agena D, Mercury - 2.5 parts introduction - probes including Mariner and Verena, and the Surveyor Moon landers
// Tier 6 - Medium-Lift Rockets - Delta III, Titan III, LDC, Atlas CELV, Gemini, First Space Stations - 3.125m parts - probes include more advanced mariners, pioneer 10/11, the first atmospheric landers (Viking anyone?) and many orbiters
// Tier 7 - Heavy-Lift Rockets - Saturn I/C, Delta IV, Atlas V, Titan IV, Big G, MOL Agena SOT - 3.75m parts - probes include Voyager and RoveMate gear
// Tier 8 - Super Heavy-Lift Rockets - Saturn V, Space Shuttle, Apollo LEM, Skylab - 5m parts - probes like Cassini and other advanced probes
// Tier 9 - Modern Rockets - Advanced Saturn Variants, Apollo Blks 3-5, VFB, Falcon 9/Heavy, Space Launch System, Vulcan, Ares I/V, Orion, Starliner, Crew/Cargo Dragon, Cygnus - modern probe missions like Juno and New Horizons
// Tier 10 - Near Future Rocketry - Advanced "game changer" rockets - Starship/BFS, New Glenn, etc - 7.5m parts - near future probe missions like Europa Clipper
// Tier 11 - Far Future Rocketry - Futuristic Prototypes and upgrades of previous parts - also SpaceY 10m tankage - AI?
